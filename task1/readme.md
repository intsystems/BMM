1.  [Reporter: Parviz Karimov]  Compare Kronecker Laplace, and standard Laplace approximation methods (in 3 variants: with full covariance, diagonal covariance, scalar covariance) for a logistic regression on a synthetic dataset generated with
 parameters generated by Gaussian distribution with full-rank covariance. The hyperparameters must be optimized. Estimate: the model performance, approximation quality, the quality of covariance restoration, speed of the method with different dataset size and dimensionality.

2.  [Reporter: Kseniia Petrushina]  Compare ELBO and standard Laplace approximation methods (in 3 variants: with full covariance, diagonal covariance, scalar covariance) for a linear regression on a synthetic dataset  parameters generated by Gaussian distribution with full-rank covariance.
Estimate quality of approximation, speed of approximation, and KL divergence between approximatng distribution and posterior distribution.

3.  [Reporter: Vladimirov Eduard]  Analyze a naive method of hyperparameter optimization from Graves 2011. Adapt it to a full and diagonal covariance matrix. Estimate covariance estimation quality for datasets generated with different covariance matrix types.

4.  [Reporter: Boeva Galina]  Run ELBO with different parameter sampling strategy for a neural network (at least 3 layers MLP). Dataset: MNIST (or more complex dataset). Parameter sampling strategies:
    - One sample per batch (see Graves, 2011)
    - One sample per batch element (naively)
    -  One sample per batch element using local reparametrization

5.  [Reporter: Dmitry Protasov]  Compare approximation for a Gaussian distribution and a Gaussian mixture using SGD, SGLD and Stein gradient descent. For each method optimize hyperparameters and show dependence of the quality from the iteration number.

6.  [Reporter: Marat Khusainov]  Compute and compare ELBO for a model with parameters distributed using Gaussian mixture. The ELBO must be computed using a simple ELBO (Graves) and using implicit reparametrization trick.

7. [Reporter: Gavrilyuk Alexander] Repeat plot 28.6 from MacKay book. Dataset: sklearn dataset. 
    Prior: normal distribution with scalar covariance. Models: multiple linear regression models:
    1. with optimal hyperparameters
    2. with lowered variance for the prior 
    3. with biased mean for the prior

8. [Reporter: Timofey Chernikov] Compare approximation  with Laplace approximation, Variational inference and Expectation propagation for:
 - Gaussian mixture (visualize for different parameters of mixture)
 - Beta-distribution with a and beta < 1  (visualize for different parameters)
